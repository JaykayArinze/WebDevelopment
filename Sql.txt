DIFFERENCES BETWEEN SQL AND NOSQL

SQL pronounced as “S-Q-L” or as “See-Quel” is primarily called RDBMS or Relational Databases whereas NoSQL is a Non-relational or Distributed Database.

Comparing SQL vs NoSQL database, SQL databases are table based databases whereas NoSQL databases can be document based, key-value pairs, graph databases.

SQL databases are vertically scalable while NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable.

SQL databases have a predefined schema whereas NoSQL databases use dynamic schema for unstructured data.

Comparing NoSQL vs SQL performance, SQL requires specialized DB hardware for better performance while NoSQL uses commodity hardware.Differences Between NoSQL and SQL 1. NoSQL is a non-relational database management system (DBMS) that does not require a fixed schema, links, or a simple scaling method. SQL databases are purely or primarily relational databases.


2. NoSQL databases are being horizontally scaled. SQL databases, on the other hand, are scaled vertically.


3. NoSQL databases can be documented using key-value pairs, graph databases, and other techniques. While SQL databases are built from tables.


4.For unstructured data, NoSQL databases utilize a dynamic schema, whereas SQL databases use a predetermined schema.


5.NoSQL database examples include MongoDB, Redid, Neo4j, Cassandra, Hbase, and others. SQL databases include Oracle, Postgres, Microsoft SQL, and others.

6. NoSQL is mostly used when the data accuracy is not necessary rather a fast growing data is needed. While SQL is mostly used when the validity of data is a necessity.
